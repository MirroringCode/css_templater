# css_templater
Just a small bash script to generate a boilerplate css file, based on css reset by Andy Bell.
This is just a little bash file for educational purposes and to generate a css file everytime I start a new project
but I'm open of others helping and improving this file, so go ahead and fork it if you wish!
